# Welcome to Sorobounty Spectacular! üé°

Between July 31 and August 18, you can earn awards for building decentralized applications (dApps) with Soroban on the Stellar network, accompanied by explanatory content (such as written tutorials, video walkthroughs, etc.). This program is part of the Stellar Development Foundation‚Äôs $100M Soroban Adoption Fund and is a precursor to Sorobanathon: Road to Mainnet. 

The goal of this program is to provide the structure for application developers to build with Soroban and provide the educational materials for other devs to get up and running quickly on the platform as we approach Mainnet launch. We‚Äôre looking for any type of dApp ‚Äî from basic cryptographic games to NFT projects. Have some fun with it!

For each qualified submission you create, you can earn an award of between $300 and $1,500 worth of XLM. 

Here are the kind of submissions we're looking for:

* Practical tutorials (such as this [DAO tutorial](https://docs.near.org/develop/relevant-contracts/dao) 
* Fun dApp tutorials (such as this [adoption tracking system for a pet shop](https://trufflesuite.com/blog/learn-ethereum-the-fun-way-with-our-pet-shop-tutorial/)
* Video walkthroughs (such as this one on creating a [simple smart contract using Solidity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNXJNeaYl8Q)

Soroban is still in preview release and is live on Futurenet, a shared test network. You may encounter some problems as you are using the platform and various tools. We encourage you to report any problems or bugs you find in our [Stellar Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/stellardev) under the #soroban channels.

## What makes a good submission

The Stellar Development Foundation (‚ÄúSDF‚Äù) will review submissions as they come in, and all Sorobounty Spectacular awards are contingent upon review and approval of the submission by SDF, in its sole discretion.

Your submission should be coherent and easy to follow. If you are creating a tutorial, the audience needs to be able to follow along. If you are writing code, what it does should be clear. All content and contract code also need to be public (GitHub, dev.to, Medium, or YouTube).

Awards will be based on the scope, complexity, and quality of the submission. That said, here is a rough idea of what certain types of submissions can earn.

If your submission is just contract (dApp) code, you are eligible to earn up to $300 worth of XLM. The award amount increases to up to $1,500 worth of XLM based on the accompanying content: from decent READMEs to published written tutorials on dev.to to video tutorials on YouTube. The more you include in your submission, the better!

**Note:** SDF is under no obligation to make any awards if there are no eligible submissions or Eligible Individuals (as defined below), or if Eligible Individuals do not successfully complete the compliance and tax obligations set forth below.

## Get Started

If you haven't already, check out the [Soroban docs](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs) to get oriented, get set up, and get your head around the Soroban fundamentals. When you're ready to create a submission:

* Click the "Discussions" tab at the top of the page
* Create a "New Discussion"
* Title your discussion thread
* Select the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù category
* Github Discussions requires you to search for similar discussion threads before creating a new thread.  It's a good idea!  That way, you can see submissions that have already been turned in.  Don't copy from any, but feel free to create something similar.
* When you're ready, check off ‚ÄúI have done a search for similar discussions.‚Äù
* Add your submission.  Feel free to put it right in the box, or to link to an external resource.
* Once you have posted, you're done!

We will review your submission within a week, and reply on your submission thread to let you know if your submission qualifies to earn an award! If so, we will ask you to complete a form to collect the info necessary to validate and deliver an award.

If your submission did not qualify, we may provide you with feedback on what's missing, or on how you can improve your submission so it qualifies. Once you have made the requested revisions, we will re-review your submission, and let you know if your submission qualifies for an award.

## Tips for picking submission topics

üí° Choose an idea:

* Picture yourself at a hackathon trying to solve a problem quickly.  What would it be? 
* Think about your own life and your own interests.  Is there something missing that you could build with Soroban? 
* In this case, you can go big, and build the whole house, or you can scope things down, and focus on a single brick.

üîé Look for inspiration:
You don't need a completely unique concept, and reviewing other approaches can jumpstart your thought process.
So check out existing smart contract tutorials for inspiration.

üåé Connect with the community:

* Be proactive, engage with other devs, and ask for feedback in the [Stellar Dev Discord](https://discord.gg/stellardev)  #soroban channels.
* Remember that this is a community we build together  üí™! Our code of conduct is [here](https://www.stellar.org/community/code-of-conduct). 

üéâ Remember to have fun!

* As long as your submission contains an end-to-end smart contract deployed on the Stellar blockchain and has an interactive interface, you‚Äôre on the right track.
