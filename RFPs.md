## Dapp Ideas

The Sorobounty Spectacular program is all about developers exploring the functionality of smart contracts and the possibilities of Soroban and then showcasing those innovative uses with the ecosystem. Building dapps in the safety of Sorobanâ€™s sandbox environment is only the first step, sharing that knowledge with written tutorials, video walkthroughs, and other educational content is the true bread and butter of the program. 

Ready to unleash your genius, but your brainâ€™s been more like a sleepy sloth than a zippy zebra? You can build almost anything with smart contracts â€” and here are some popular ideas to get your noggin neurons dancing. ðŸ•ºðŸ’¡

### Games:

- Rock-paper-scissors: A classic hand game with three outcomes.
- Tic-tac-toe: A two-player game where players mark a 3x3 grid with their symbol.
- Game of Life: A cellular automaton where cells evolve in steps (link).
- On-chain Squid Game: A blockchain version of challenges from the popular show.
- Hot potato contract: A fun game where participants pass on a 'hot potato' token.

### Financial Tools & Primitives:
