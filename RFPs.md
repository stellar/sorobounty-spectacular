Ready to unleash your genius at the Sorobounty Spectacular? Submit away! But if your brain's been more like a sleepy sloth than a zippy zebra, here's a little nudge to get the noggin neurons dancing! ðŸ•ºðŸ’¡

### Foundational Financial Primitives

#### Swap Functionality/AMM:

- **Decentralized Exchange**:
  - Create a platform that allows users to trade tokens without intermediaries. Users can provide liquidity, earn fees, and swap tokens.

#### Lending/Borrowing Markets:

- **Crypto-collateralized Loan Platform**:
  - Design a system where users can lock tokens as collateral to borrow other tokens. Users pay interest, and liquidations happen if collateral falls below a threshold.

#### Oracles:

- **Weather Betting dapp**:
  - Design a dapp where users bet on tomorrow's weather. The dapp uses a trusted weather oracle to fetch accurate weather data and distribute rewards.
